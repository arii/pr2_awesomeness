roslaunch pr2_awesomeness pr2_launch.launch for running AR tags.  (Will need openni package and ee_cart_imped.)


./pr2_interface will run a program to pick up an object near AR tag id 0 and place the object near
AR tag 1.


This process will fail if the object is too far away and is infeasible to grasp or place.  I would
look into trying to speed up the pick and place manager from the pr2_pick_and_place_demos package to
speed up this process.
